## Installation

I host a copy of this program at [sharkswithswords.com](http://sharkswithswords.com/desktop/html/color-palette-generator.html), but it will likely not be updated more than once every week or so.

Alternatively, you can clone the repository by typing this into your terminal:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/lost-possum/color-gen.git
```

After cloning, it would be easiest to open up the project in VS Code and run it in a live server environment. Please make sure to keep the directory's structure intact, or it will fail to work.

I plan to introduce an easier way to use this locally in the future. Probably with the full release of 1.0.
